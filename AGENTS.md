# Guidance for AI Agents Working on This Repo

This file documents patterns, constraints, and helpful procedures for Claude Code or other AI agents assisting with this repository.

## Repo Overview

- **Purpose:** Collection of independent BepInEx/HarmonyX mods for *The Planet Crafter* (Unity game with multiplayer support via Unity Netcode for GameObjects).
- **Structure:** Each mod is a standalone `.csproj` project in its own folder, producing a separate DLL.
- **Shared code pattern:** No DLL references between mods. Shared utilities (e.g., `AedenthornUtils.cs`, `NetcodeUtils.cs`) are **source-linked** via MSBuild `<Compile Include>` directives in each consuming mod's `.csproj` — they are compiled directly into each mod's assembly, not referenced as external DLLs.
- **Build system:** MSBuild `.targets` files (`solution.targets`, `solution_private.targets`) handle game DLL resolution and common properties.
- **Solution file:** `PlanetCrafterMods.sln` — most mods are included; some unrelated/legacy projects may have issues (e.g., missing dependencies).

## Before Building

Check that `solution_private.targets` exists and is configured:

```bash
ls -la d:\Development\PlanetCrafterMods\solution_private.targets
```

This file should define `<GamePath>` pointing to your Planet Crafter installation. Example:

```xml
<GamePath>F:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\The Planet Crafter</GamePath>
```

If missing or misconfigured, the build will fail to resolve game DLLs. **Do not attempt to create this file yourself** — it is machine-local and gitignored (user's game install path is private).

## After a Full Build

A full `dotnet build PlanetCrafterMods.sln` creates hundreds of temporary artifacts:

- **~50 projects × 2 = ~100 `bin/` and `obj/` directories** (each project has both Debug and Release configs)
- **One `.zip` file per project** (packaged build outputs, typically in `<project>\bin\<config>\Release\`)
- **Total disk usage: ~150–200 MB of temporary files**

**Always run the cleanup script after a full build** to restore the workspace to a clean state:

```powershell
.\cleanup-build-artifacts.ps1
```

This is safe — it only removes `bin/`, `obj/`, and `.zip` files; all source code remains untouched. Run it before checking git status or committing, to avoid accidentally staging build artifacts.

## Key Files and Conventions

| File/Path | Purpose | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| `README.md` | Root-level mod documentation | Covers installation, configuration per-mod settings. |
| `netcode.md` | Multiplayer netcode architecture guide | Explains Unity NGO model, safe APIs, and common anti-patterns. Reference for fixing mods. |
| `solution.targets` | Shared MSBuild imports | Defines game DLL references, `Unity.Netcode.Runtime`, etc. |
| `solution_private.targets` | Machine-local build config (gitignored) | User's game path; created/maintained by user only. |
| `AedenthornUtils/AedenthornUtils.cs` | Shared utilities (source-linked) | Key/input helpers, asset path handling, etc. |
| `AedenthornUtils/NetcodeUtils.cs` | Netcode-safe helpers (source-linked) | Role detection, async inventory transfer. Added in recent fix. |
| `reference/decompiled-il/` | Game code evidence (IL disassembly) | Backing evidence for netcode.md claims. See `reference/decompiled-il/README.md`. |

## Working with Mods

### Source-Linking Shared Code

If a mod needs to use `AedenthornUtils` or `NetcodeUtils`, add to its `.csproj`:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <Compile Include="..\AedenthornUtils\AedenthornUtils.cs" Link="AedenthornUtils.cs" />
  <Compile Include="..\AedenthornUtils\NetcodeUtils.cs" Link="NetcodeUtils.cs" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Do **not** add a project reference — the source file is compiled directly into the mod's DLL.

### Harmony Patching Best Practices

- Use `AccessTools.FieldRefAccess<T, FieldType>` to safely reflect into private fields.
- Use `AccessTools.Method()` to locate methods with ambiguous overloads.
- Patches run in static contexts (no component `this` reference). Use `NetworkManager.Singleton` for netcode checks, never assume a `NetworkBehaviour` instance is in scope.
- See `netcode.md` section 2 for the canonical role-detection idiom.

### Netcode Awareness (Multiplayer Mods)

**Read `netcode.md` before writing any code that mutates inventories or spawns/destroys world objects.**

Common anti-patterns to avoid:
- ❌ Direct `Inventory.AddItem()` / `RemoveItem()` calls (non-networked `List<T>` mutations)
- ❌ Direct `WorldObjectsHandler.CreateNewWorldObject()` calls (local allocation, no spawn replication)
- ❌ Relying on synchronous completion of `InventoriesHandler` wrapper methods (all async, deferred via ClientRpc callback)

Use instead:
- ✅ `InventoriesHandler.Instance.AddItemToInventory(...)` / `RemoveItemFromInventory(...)` with async callbacks
- ✅ `WorldObjectsHandler.CreateAndInstantiateWorldObject(...)` / `CreateAndDropOnFloor(...)` / `DestroyWorldObject(...)`
- ✅ `NetcodeUtils.MoveItemBetweenInventories(...)` for safe item transfers

See `netcode.md` section 3 (Safe Entry Points) for the full reference table.

## Testing and Verification

- **Build verification:** `dotnet build PlanetCrafterMods.sln -c Release` should complete with no errors in QuickStore, CustomWeatherEvents, and other "known good" mods. (Some mods like Cheats, CustomAudio, ConstructToInventory may have pre-existing issues unrelated to your changes.)
- **Quick mod test:** `dotnet build <ModFolder>/<ModName>.csproj -c Release` builds just one mod.
- **Cleanup before status check:** Always run `.\cleanup-build-artifacts.ps1` before `git status` to avoid staging temp files.

## Investigation Evidence

The `reference/decompiled-il/` folder contains IL disassembly of game classes. This is preserved evidence, not auto-generated. If you need to verify netcode API signatures or understand RPC dispatch patterns:

1. Check `reference/decompiled-il/*.il` files for existing IL (faster than re-decompiling).
2. If the evidence is missing or outdated, re-disassemble the game DLL:
   ```bash
   ildasm.exe "F:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\The Planet Crafter\Planet Crafter_Data\Managed\Assembly-CSharp.dll" /out:full-dump.il
   ```
   Then extract individual class blocks and add to `reference/decompiled-il/`.

See `reference/decompiled-il/README.md` for detailed regeneration steps.

## Git Workflow

- **No destructive operations without confirmation:** Always check `git status` before `git reset --hard` or similar.
- **Commit message style:** Brief, imperative ("Add X", "Fix Y", "Refactor Z"), referencing the mod(s) affected and the reason (not just the what).
- **Ignore build artifacts:** `.gitignore` should already exclude `bin/`, `obj/`, `*.zip`, and `solution_private.targets`. If you see these in `git status`, run the cleanup script and re-check.

## Known Issues and Limitations

- **Some mods have pre-existing build failures** (e.g., Cheats depends on `MijuTools`, ConstructToInventory has API drift in `WorldObjectsHandler.CreateNewWorldObject`). These are not blockers for other mod work — the solution builds with warnings/errors but other mods succeed.
- **solution_private.targets is gitignored** — each developer must create their own, pointing to their game installation. The repo won't build without it (you'll get DLL resolution errors). If you see a build error like "Assembly-CSharp.dll not found," check that `solution_private.targets` exists.
- **No IL disassembler installed by default** — use `ildasm.exe` (part of .NET Framework SDK) or install ILSpy/dnSpy if you need interactive decompilation.

## For Future Work

When fixing other mods identified in `netcode.md`'s audit table (CraftFromContainers, AutoMine, ChatCommands, SpawnObject, ConstructToInventory, Delete):

1. Read the audit entry and understand the exact anti-pattern.
2. Refer to `netcode.md` section 3 (Safe Entry Points) for the replacement API.
3. If the fix involves async operations (likely), follow the QuickStore restructuring pattern: upfront snapshots, local optimistic state tracking, async callbacks for side effects.
4. Source-link `NetcodeUtils` for role detection and inventory transfer helpers.
5. Test in both host and remote-client multiplayer modes.
6. Update the audit table in `netcode.md` and commit with a note about the fix.
